# CS360
The goal was to create an inventory tracking application that would allow the user to add/delete items, increase/decrease stock levels, and notify the user if the stock of an item dropped too low. 
The screens necessary included a login screen, a grid screen with the items, and a stock screen of each item. My UI designs were kept simple so that the app stayed intuitive for the user and was easy to use from the start.
I started by creating the UI and making a navigation of the screens. Then I tried to go one by one and connect the different screens when I was coding by starting with the login screen. I would want to plan it out better in the future since it felt like I was jumping around a lot trying to figure out what I needed to do next.
I kept testing my code as I was going by debugging but also running the app and seeing how it worked. I don't think I ever got it fully debugged but its a lengthy and intensive process that is really never done. 
I had a lot of code going back an forth so I had to work to simplfy everything. I find that with coding its easy to have big ideas that aren't necessarily achievable in the time given.

I think the thing I was most successful with is Ui since that is soemthing I don't have a lot of experience in.
